CPP08/ex00

	STL is allowed and you have to use it
	Algorithm library is allowed and have to use it

	 Write an function template easyfind(T*, int)
		- T is a container of int
		- easyfind returns first occurrence of second param in the first param
		- return is an exception if not found
			- but a normal error message is find if too much
		- (should behave like a standard container) 


	Important: You don't have to handle associative containers
		- What on earth is an associative container
		- Oh, like maps and sets
